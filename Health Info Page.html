        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eat a Variety of Foods:</strong>  Include a mix of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats to ensure you get essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.</li>
            <li><strong>Portion Control:</strong> Watch portion sizes to avoid overeating. Using smaller plates and being mindful of serving sizes can help control calorie intake.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit Processed Foods:</strong> Minimize consumption of highly processed and sugary foods. These can contribute to weight gain and chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Water aids in digestion, nutrient absorption, and keeping your body functioning properly.</li>

            <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Engage in muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week, such as weight lifting or resistance exercises. This helps maintain muscle mass, supports bone health, and increases metabolism.</li>
